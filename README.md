**Scan for WiFi devices, block selected connections, create dozens of networks and confuse WiFi scanners.**

## Hackbutt v3 Documentation

Hackbutt v3 was created by [rot13labs](https://rot13labs.com) for security professionals to test their networks
for wireless vulnerabilities. While its release coincides with DEFCON 31 please DO NOT use this badge at or
around the casinos. They do not mess around when it comes to their security and creating issues for them could
cause issues for DEFCON and/or for #badgelife, so DFIU!

This badge was only made possible because of the incredible work done by [Spacehuhn Technologies](https://github.com/SpacehuhnTech) so if you enjoy this badge, please consider supporting them and the work they do for our community.

## WebUI

The password for the `hackbutt` wireless network is `rot13labs`. Once you log in, browse to 192.168.4.1 or go to 
http://deauth.me to access the webUI. Hackbutt can be controlled via this webUI for easier management.

## About this Project

This firmware allows you to easily perform a variety of actions to test 802.11 networks using an [ESP8266](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp8266). It's also a great project for learning about WiFi, microcontrollers, Arduino, hacking and electronics/programming in general.  

The deauthentication attack is the main feature, which can be used to disconnect devices from their WiFi network.  
Although this denial-of-service attack is nothing new, a lot of devices are still vulnerable to it. Luckily this is slowly changing with more WiFi 6 enabled devices being used. But a lot of outdated WiFi devices remain in place, for example in cheap IoT hardware.
With an ESP8266 Deauther, you can easily test this attack on your 2.4GHz WiFi network/devices and see whether it's successful or not. And if it is, you know you should upgrade your network.
